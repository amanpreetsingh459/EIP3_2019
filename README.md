# EIP3_2019

This repository contains the code and other relative files and materials pertaining to the **EIP3**(**E**xternal **I**nternship **P**rogram - version3, 2019). The course name is **Dive into Deep Neural Networks**. It is hosted by **inkers.ai** and powered by **NASSCOM's CoE for IoT & AI and NVIDIA**. NASSCOM is collaborating in the program for empowering the AI learning ecosystem. NVIDIA has provided their leading experts for some of the advanced sessions.

## Syllabus

### Phase-1
- **DFX: Right from Basics :-**
There are no pre-requisites for this program, so required programming and mathematical background will be covered. This program is designed as much as for a Doctor as is it for an Engineer.

- **VISUAL ARCHITECTURE: Convolution Neural Networks(CNNs) :-** 
The advancements in last 4 years has helped us understand a lot more about CNN, so much so that they are not black boxes anymore. We today know how many layers must be there in a network, or how many kernels must we add!

### Phase-2
- **UNSUPERVISED: Advanced Concepts & Latest Trends :-**
We will cover the object detection and similar complex concepts in depth. We will also introduce 9 different kinds of Convolutions you might not be aware of, and areas they are useful into.

### Phase-3
- **RL: GANs & LSTMs :-**
We will understand why GANs matter today, and how do we train them. We will also cover LSTMs in depth. Equipped with GANs and LSTM you'll be ready for the real AI, Reinforcement Learning

### Phase-4
- **END2END: Reinforcement Learning :-**
Reinforcement Learning is paving the path to true AI. ML covered until this topic was in Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, but their true potential would be realized through RL.
